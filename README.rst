_"we must treat the data center itself as one massive warehouse-scale computer"_ - Luiz Andr√© Barroso

At the core I created shylock because I feel there is little sanity programming in a modern distributed system. To get more sanity it was going to require decoupling in some sepcific places, integrated with enough systems and provide configuration for quality of service.

1. Everything is a file (file system): key / value (object stores), message queues ect
   1. Examples: S3, Etcd, redis pub/sub, kafka ect
1. Quality of Service (QOS): given a key or path limit the resource based on read/write bytes or operations
   1. Example: User (/mnt/lhj) can only write 1024K per second, read 512K per second

This would not be possible if it wasn't for the great work done by the Fuse_ project. By making writing a `fuse<https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse>`_ file system in Go amazingly easy I can't thank the developers enough. 

Status
------

Currently shylock is in Proof of Concept (POC). The next step is to get enough integration's to be useful for users. Before an integration goes to beta status it will need:

* QOS if applicable
* Unit Tests
* Functional Tests
* Benchmarks

Name
----

In Shakespearean time `Shylock<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shylock>`_ common meaning was "white hair" which I am going to ~= meaning "gray beard" in Unix. This is the inspiration for the name.


Development Notes
-----------------

At the core shylock is a Go `API<./api>`_ for mounting accessing file like resources in a distributed system as a file. This allows for a developer to implement a single interface and get support for both Fuse_ and Docker Volumes. At some point QOS will be added as an optional interface.

Development Kafka Notes
```````````````````````

* Kafka defaults environment variables KAFKA_BROKERS=127.0.0.1:9092 and KAFKA_TOPIC="my_topic"
* Kafka and or Zookeeper will probably crash or heavily abuse resources don't run it always in the background
  * Zookeeper has used up all my disk space
  * Kafka eventually staves out my VM's without it sending or receiving any messages
 
### Usage

#### Etcd

  For more details `shylock etcd docs <docs/etcd.rst>`_

.. highlight:: bash

  shylock etcd /mnt/localhost/etcd/

Mount as read only
------------------

ETC_READ_ONLY="true" shylock etcd /mnt/localhost/etcd/

Redis
`````

Redis currently just uses pubsub message system. This makes it very easy to broadcast messages out.

.. highlight:: bash

   shylock redis /mnt/localhost/redis/

Environment variables with the defaults:  REDIS_HOST=localhost:6379 REDIS_PASSWORD="" REDIS_DB=0 shylock redis /mnt/localhost/redis/

TODO:

* Key / Value store
* Task queue system

PathQOS 
:::::::

.. highlight:: bash

   IOC_FILE=/tmp/shylock.csv PATHQOS_DIR=/mnt/b shylock pathqos /mnt/a

With this csv as an example:

::

  /mnt/b/foo/foo/,1000,2,2
  /mnt/b/bar/foo/,2000,3,3
  /mnt/b/bar/bar/,3000,4,4

Kafka 
:::::

  shylock kafka $HOME/mnt/localhost


### Rest API Examples

Create a new path configuration:


  ```
  curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"key":"/home/lhj/mnt/b/foo/monkey/","read_limit":10,"write_limit":10}' http://localhost:7070/key/home/lhj/mnt/b/foo/monkey/

  curl http://localhost:7070/key/home/lhj/mnt/b/foo/monkey/

  {"key":"/home/lhj/mnt/b/foo/monkey/","read_limit":10,"write_limit":10}
   ```
Update a configuration:

   ```
   curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"key":"/home/lhj/mnt/b/foo/monkey/","read_limit":20,"write_limit":20}' http://localhost:7070/key/home/lhj/mnt/b/foo/monkey/

   http://localhost:7070/key/home/lhj/mnt/b/foo/monkey/

   {"key":"/home/lhj/mnt/b/foo/monkey/","read_limit":20,"write_limit":20}
```
